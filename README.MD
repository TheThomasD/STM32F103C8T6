To use this with, you have to install the [32 bit version of Java](https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp). Other versions may cause an access violation error. Also, the correct USB bootloader has to be installed on the board (e.g. the PC13 version, if that is written on your board) from [here](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader/tree/master/bootloader_only_binaries). This has to be done via an ST-LINK V2 programmer or via the serial interface (see e.g. [here](https://cool-web.de/arduino/stm32duino-bootloader-flashen-fuer-usb-zugriff-auf-stm32.htm)).
